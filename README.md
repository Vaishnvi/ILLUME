# To miss-attend is to misalign! Residual Self-Attentive Feature Alignment for Adapting Object Detectors (ILLUME)

Adaptive object detection remains challenging due to visual diversity in background scenes and intricate combinations of objects. Motivated by structural importance, we aim to attend prominent instance-specific regions, overcoming the feature misalignment issue. 

We propose a novel resIduaL seLf-attentive featUre alignMEnt ( ILLUME ) method for adaptive object detection. ILLUME comprises Self-Attention Feature Map (SAFM) module that enhances structural attention to object-related regions and thereby generates domain invariant features.

Our approach significantly reduces the domain distance with the improved feature alignment of the instances.
